<h1>SWITZERLAND</h1>
<p>I moved to Switzerland right after school at 17 years old. I started styudying at ETH during the Covid-19 pandemic, which definitely influenced my perception of the country. However, Switzerland had already been a part of my life since I was little. My family and I went skiing in St. Moritz every year or came here during the summer and I will always feel at home here.</p>
