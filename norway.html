<h1>NORWAY</h1>
<p>My first trip to Norway was back in .... I went with my family to one of the northermost places in Norway, Alta. The landscapes and experiences this place offers are in my opinion unparalleled. Norway soon became one of my favourite countries in Europe and made my wish to discover more of Scandinavia grow.</p>
